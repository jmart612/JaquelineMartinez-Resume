        <div class="subheading mb-5">PsychologyðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Second-year undergraduate student currently attending The University of California, Riverside. I plan to major in Psychology with a focus on law and society. After graduation, I would like to attend graduate school to further my education or perhaps even enlist in the military. My main goal would be to work in a government office as my degrees would allow me to have a unique perspective. I would love to perhaps move out of the States and start my career somewhere else thats new and different for some time. In order to be successful you need to expand your knowledge and have an open mind. Times are changing and we are at a crossroads in our nations regarding politics. Although these are just some options I would like to keep my mind open as we never know where life leads us to and our paths might change.  <br><br>

        Although I would like to be successful in my career, I would also love to give back to my community. I have been volunteering since high school in the Women's Shelter and through hospital volunteering. I have also helped build gardens in parks. However, I have found that I most enjoy helping people face to face. My childhood has really allowed me to connect with peoples struggles and be able to simply help out without needing something in return. I have enjoyed working at the hospital the most becaused it feels as though I might be able to really make a difference. During my time volunteering I did so much and I really enjoyed having the responsibility and ensuring that I made nurses jobs much more easier than harder. It brings meaning to life and it allows me to do more than just a job. Life is much more than making money and buying the most luxurious things plus seeing cute babies in the hospital is always a plus.  <br><br>

        I have recently enjoyed being able to travel and get to know more people and cultures. Its important to know your roots but also expand your knowledge as you mature. Theres simply so much I would love to do before I retire and it would simply be amazing to find a job that not only I love but allows me to do the things that I love as well. Its important to explore whats out there and knowing more than just your hometown and places you are comfortable in. Its then when you grow and get to know who you really are and the goals you want to set for yourself.
